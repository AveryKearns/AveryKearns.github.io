        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>As you may know, my name is Avery. I was born in Montreal but have lived in the Ottawa area for most of my life. My passions are many but the top of them would be martial arts. Second would be media and all the corresponds with it. Video games, TV shows, and movies are all things I love to consume. Circling back to the topic of video games, I have really been sinking my teeth into bethesda games. I've never been one for role-playing games like the older fallout games or the elder scrolls series, but I'm really finding the survival genre and the world-building aspects of these games to be very engaging.</p>
        <p>I hope to learn as much as I can about this program and the opportunities it will give me. So far this is the course I find to be the most interesting and stimulating. Later on, I'm gonna apply myself in a professional aspect and get real work. I feel as though I'm rediscovering myself and my interests. I'm really interested in applying the skills that I learn here into my passions and hopefully find jobs and careers that border or even involve some of these things that I love. That's all for me, I look forward to hearing your feedback.</p>
