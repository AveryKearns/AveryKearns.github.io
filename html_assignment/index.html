        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>As you may know, my name is Avery. I was born in Montreal but have lived in the Ottawa area for most of my life. My passions are many but the <strong>top</strong> of them would be martial arts. <strong>2<sup>nd</sup></strong> would be media and all that corresponds with it. Video games, <abbr title="Television">TV</abbr> shows, and movies are all things I love to consume. Circling back to the topic of video games, I have really been sinking my teeth into bethesda. I've never really been one for role-playing games like the <em>fallout</em> series, but I'm really finding the world-building aspects of these <em>games</em> to be very engaging. the things I enjoy have to stimulate my brain in some way for me to really stick with them. I feel very happy lately as well.</p>
            <p>I hope to learn as much as I can about this program and the opportunities it will give me. So far this is the course I find to be the most interesting and stimulating. Later on, I'm gonna apply myself in a professional aspect and get real work. I feel as though I'm rediscovering myself and my interests. I'm really looking forward to applying the skills and knowledge that I learn here to build into my passions. Hopefully I'll find jobs and careers that border or even involve some of these things that I love. I guess that wraps this up pretty well. That's all for my article.</p>
